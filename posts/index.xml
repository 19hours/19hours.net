      <description>Working at home is nice and comfy but a flaky internet connection can make everyone go crazy. So this morning I took the spare routers that you get from recontracting your ISP plans to reproduce a 4g internet experience at home. It&amp;rsquo;s super fast and convenient because every device switches to the best access point on its own. No more manually switching to different bands when you&amp;rsquo;re close to the router and when you&amp;rsquo;re not.</description>

      <description>Because the elections are coming, I tried to understand what laws were introduced and what changes were made to the laws since the last election. I visited sso.agc.gov.sg and they have this timeline box on each page and you have to select a date to see a version of the statute. There was no way to compare different versions on the same screen.
Today, I created a git repository to track all changes to the statutes.</description>

      <description>When I was younger, one of the most frustrating things I had to do was to book a badminton court. You had to be ready two weeks before the actual day to spam the refresh key until the portal released the bookings. I was always so annoyed because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how it was possible for people in their 50s to be clicking faster than me. Back then, simply using a fast computer and having multiple tabs would beat most people.</description>

      <title>Trace Together&#39;s privacy, or lack thereof</title>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I saw the announcement for a new app called TraceTogether. It’s an app by the government to make contact tracing easier. The app appeared on a lot of news websites because it’s a good smart nation initiative.
I was interested to find out how Bluetooth was used. I launched my terminal and decompiled the app using Jadx to find out what’s powering the app.
The app uses bluetooth to log other people’s devices around you.</description>
