      <description>Because the elections are coming, I tried to understand what laws were introduced and what changes were made to the laws since the last election. I visited sso.agc.gov.sg and they have this timeline box on each page and you have to select a date to see a version of the statute. There was no way to compare different versions on the same screen.
Today, I created a git repository to track all changes to the statutes.</description>
