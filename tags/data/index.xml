      <description>Because the elections are coming, I tried to understand what laws were introduced and what changes were made to the laws since the last election. I visited sso.agc.gov.sg and they have this timeline box on each page and you have to select a date to see a version of the statute. There was no way to compare different versions on the same screen.
Today, I created a git repository to track all changes to the statutes.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I saw the announcement for a new app called TraceTogether. It’s an app by the government to make contact tracing easier. The app appeared on a lot of news websites because it’s a good smart nation initiative.
I was interested to find out how Bluetooth was used. I launched my terminal and decompiled the app using Jadx to find out what’s powering the app.
The app uses bluetooth to log other people’s devices around you.</description>
